# Dataset description

The dataset presents a 14-day measure utilizing the Aloe vera plant. The following parameters were captured using a simple ESP32 hardware environment consisting of several sensors (see sensor details above):

- temperature,
- humidity,
- moisture and
- light.

Each data point is accompanied by the time and date stamp of the captured event.
